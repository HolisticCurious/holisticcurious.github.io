<h2>About</h2>


<p>
The content found here will be of little interest to most individuals. 
It is an aggregator of thoughts, most of which have been published elsewhere. 
Some drafts may end up here. A selfish demand of online space.
</p>

<p>
Some other projects may be linked here. I am still trying to find an academical passion.
So, bare with me and with the discontinuity of content and subjects.

About me: from Coruche, Portugal. MSc Biomedical Engineering (IST, Lisboa).
